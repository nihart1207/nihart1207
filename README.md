## 💫 About Me
I’m a **Software Developer with over three years of experience** designing and developing scalable, data-driven applications and backend systems. My work focuses on blending **software engineering, data analytics, and cloud computing** to create high-performance solutions that drive impact.

I’m passionate about building **robust ETL pipelines**, **microservice-based architectures**, and **cloud-native workflows** that enhance reliability, efficiency, and scalability. Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with **Python, Node.js, SQL, and AWS**, optimizing systems that process millions of records while maintaining data integrity and performance.

Currently, I’m exploring **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to create smarter, context-aware systems, and I’m expanding my expertise in **Big Data technologies** like **Hive, Spark, Hadoop, and Snowflake**.

What drives me is the joy of problem-solving — whether it’s optimizing database performance, streamlining data flows, or designing intuitive APIs. I love working at the intersection of data and engineering, where creativity meets precision.
